Python-Based Virus Project -
Project Overview
This project is a simple Python-based virus created for educational purposes as part of my exploration into cybersecurity. The virus demonstrates various disruptive behaviors in a controlled environment, allowing users to understand the potential impact of malware and explore defensive strategies.

Features -
Random Mouse Movement: The mouse cursor moves to random positions every 0.1 seconds.
Continuous Clicking: The program continuously performs double right/left clicks.
Random Scrolling: The screen scrolls up and down at random intervals.
Text Insertion: The virus types "Lucifer is watching" continuously in any open text field or writing prompt.
User Control: The virus can be easily stopped by force shutting down the system, ensuring safety during testing.

How to Use -
Run the Script: Execute the .py file to start the virus.
Observe Behavior: The virus will immediately start performing the actions described above.
Stop the Virus: To stop the virus, simply force shut down the computer.

Important Notes -
Safety: This virus does not include any code for auto-running on startup or disabling the keyboard, making it safe to test in a controlled environment.
Educational Purpose: This project is intended solely for educational purposes. Please use responsibly and do not deploy it on any unauthorized systems.
